Chapter 2 - The Rainy Day

It was not long before the little Avocado awoke in a stupor. He was in a dark room and all he could see was some dim beams of light streaming in through cracks all around him. As he slowly rolled over, he began to notice that he was completely surrounded by hay and a strange suffocating heat. What had happened? What was this place? The little Avocado felt uneasy and as his little eyes adjusted to the darkness he started moving across the hay to try to find a way out. He bumped againts a broom and felt a bruise starting to form on his thick black skin. In a sudden burst of frustration he ran across the room stamping the hay down wherever he landed. He reached a wall. He felt wooden planks, and tried to peer through the cracks but the cracks were too small. He moved to the left, and back to the right, but soon noticed there definitely did not seem to be a door on this side. He sighed deeply, pushing even more hot air into the suffocating heat. All he wanted was to get out of this strange place and find a way home. He slowly made his way back to where he awoke, noticing that he had left a little trail of avocado peels when he angrily stamped this way. He realized his bruise was actually a very deep scrape. He started to panic, and frantically looked around for a bandage, or a cloth, or anything to stop his Avocado skin from falling off. He was hyperventilating and the heat wasn't helping. Then suddenly the cracks of light started to blur and fade, and everything became black.
