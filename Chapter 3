A massive, pounding headache wakes the little avocado up. "Not again" he thinks. "I really should go to Avocados Anonymous next week, this is turning into a serious problem." The little avocado looked around and discovered he was in the Vondelpark, not  knowing how he ended up there. "Why did I let Thomas pursuade me to go to that shady restaurant, Amsterfood." he thinks to himself looking around and trying to find some painkillers in his backpack. "Sure glad I didn't end up at Thomas's Meat Palace though" the little avocado's says to himself. And he wanders off happily ever after, seeing a pair of blue Nike sneakers sticking from under a bush.
