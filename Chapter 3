A massive, pounding headache wakes the little avocado up. "Not again" he thinks. "I really should go to Avocados Anonymous next week, this is turning into a serious problem." The little avocado looked around and discovered he was in the Vondelpark, not  knowing how he ended up there. "Why did I let Thomas pursuade me to go to that shady restaurant, Amsterfood." he thinks to himself looking around and trying to find some painkillers in his backpack.

He pops an asparin and looks up at the sunny sky. "Where is that crazy guy from Leeds anyway?"
